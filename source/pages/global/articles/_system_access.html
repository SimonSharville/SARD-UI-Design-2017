  <p>Navigating a new system can be a challenging experience but you're not alone. We've provided access to the following forms of help and support:</p>

      <span class="icon"></span>
      <h4>Online Chat Support (Monday to Friday - 9am - 5pm)</h4>
      <p></p>
      <img alt="Chat-image" src="/assets/images/chat-image.png">
      <p>During the hours of 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday, a "Live Support Online" button will appear similar to the one in the picture above but positioned in the bottom left corner of the screen. If you have any questions about the system you can talk to the team at SARD by simply clicking on the green button and initiating a chat session.</p>
      <span class="icon"></span>
      <h4>Knowledge base, support questions, feedback and suggestions</h4>
      <p></p>
      <img alt="Help-and-feedback" src="/assets/images/help-and-feedback-image.png">
      <p>In the bottom right corner of each page is a help and feedback button. This gives you access to context sensitive support information that guides you through the appraisal process. You can also suggest features or submit a support query.</p>
      <span class="icon"></span>
