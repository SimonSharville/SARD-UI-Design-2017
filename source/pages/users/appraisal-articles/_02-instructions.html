    <h3 class="">Portfolio</h3>
    <p>Before starting your appraisal, you should add any supporting evidence to the datasets in your portfolio. The datasets in the portfolio are mapped to the four domains and twelve domain attributes from the GMC’s Good Medical Practice portfolio.</p>
    <p>The portfolio allows you to gather evidence over a number of years. It is a repository of supporting evidence for your annual appraisal. The information entered into the portfolio will remain there from year to year and can be updated at any time. The portfolio automatically links all relevant evidence to the appraisal, which avoids having to enter and upload evidence twice.</p>

    <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">You cannot submit your appraisal unless every dataset in your portfolio is marked green, amber or N/A.</div>

    <h3 class="">Appraisal</h3>
    <p>This form is intended to hold the information required for a medical appraisal. It has been designed with the appraisal meeting in mind, in a logical manner that mirrors how the appraisal conversation may flow. It is also intended as a practical demonstration of the information in the Medical Appraisal Guide (RST, 2016) which can be viewed here.</p>

    <p>All aspects of a medical practitioner’s role can be, and should be, detailed within this form, including clinical, managerial and academic work, research, private practice, locum work and voluntary roles.</p>

    <p>Doctors should complete up to and including Section 18 and submit the package of information to the appraiser by a mutually agreed date. Sections 19, 20, 21 and 22 will be completed during and immediately after the appraisal meeting by both the doctor and the appraiser.</p>

    <p>Once all mandatory fields have been completed and all sections are marked as complete, the form will <bold>automatically</bold> lock down and a 'read only' version will be sent to the RO. <bold>You cannot reverse this step</bold> so please ensure that all of the information that both parties wish to be documented has been included.</p>

    <h3 class="">Saving</h3>
    <p>Click 'Save Section' after you have made any changes to a section. If the section is complete click 'Mark As Complete'. This will change the RAG status of the section to green.</p>

    <h3 class="">Submitting supporting information</h3>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li>Many file types can be uploaded as supporting information including Word and Excel documents, PowerPoint slides, pdfs and image files.</li>
      <li>If you intend to provide any files separately you should still list them in the appropriate section, and comment on them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="">Helpful hints</h3>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li>An asterisk (*) next to a question denotes that this field is compulsory and you will not be able to submit the form at the end unless it is completed</li>
      <li>The <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign turq"></span> buttons provide more information about what should be included in each section or field. Many contain hyperlinks to further sources of information.</li>
      <li>All text boxes expand so you can write as much as you like. You can also copy and paste information into them.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
      Remember, you are providing this information to your appraiser. </br></br>

      After your appraisal is signed off, your responsible officer will be able to view the form, specifically to read the appraiser’s statements, the appraisal summary, and your personal development plan. Your responsible officer may also access to the rest of this form and all of your supporting information. </br></br>

      You should take care to abide by local confidentiality, data security and information governance protocols. In particular, you should remove all personally identifiable data.
